# Deep-Learning-for-Extreme-Multi-label-Text-Classification

## Basic Introduction
This package will need Libtorch module at the same level of this README file.
Installation guide: [Libtorch Installation](https://pytorch.org/cppdocs/installing.html)

## Datasets and Embedding
Before running the code, we need to download the datasets and embedding
[Hedwig-Data](https://git.uwaterloo.ca/jimmylin/hedwig-data)
The needed file is in `hedwig-data/embeddings/` and put it into `word2vec/`
The file should have name of `GoogleNews-vectors-negative300.txt`
