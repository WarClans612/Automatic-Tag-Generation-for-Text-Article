# Datasets and Embedding
Before running the code, we need to download the datasets and embedding
[Hedwig-Data](https://git.uwaterloo.ca/jimmylin/hedwig-data)
The needed file is in `hedwig-data/embeddings/` and put it into `word2vec/`
The file should have name of `GoogleNews-vectors-negative300.txt`
